# Flutter starter code

This repo serves as basic starter code for flutter projects. It's considered to be a living document as it will change overtime as experience
will drive further changes to structure, dependencies and usage of this boiler plate code.

## Getting Started
Clone repo

Navigate to cloned code in editor of choice, look at open TODOs. The open TODO's guide the immediate changes to the code upon initial clone of repo.

Optional - Delete .git directory to remove previous history of commits since they're not needed once the code is change.

## Steps
Copy the lib/ directory & main.dart file into a newly generated flutter project to avoid manually updating references of 'flutter_starter' to be the new project name.
